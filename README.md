# MSDS590_Capstone
Forecasting stress, anxiety, and affect using time-series analysis of HRV and EDA from the WESAD dataset.

## 📌 Overview

This repository will contain all code, data processing steps, models, and results for my Biomedical Data Science Capstone project at Meharry Medical College. The project focuses on forecasting self-reported stress, anxiety, and affective states using time-series data from wearable physiological sensors.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Forecast the next minute of self-reported emotional state using the previous 10 minutes of HRV and EDA data.
- Compare classification models for stress/anxiety and regression models for positive/negative affect.
- Evaluate generalization to unseen patients and lab-induced conditions.
