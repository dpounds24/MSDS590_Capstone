Forecasting stress, anxiety, and affect using time-series analysis of HRV and EDA from the WESAD dataset.

## 📌 Overview

This repository will contain all code, data processing steps, models, and results for my Biomedical Data Science Capstone project at Meharry Medical College. The project explores the prediction of self-reported psychological states—stress, anxiety, positive affect (PA), and negative affect (NA)-using wearable physiological data.

To evaluate the importance of temporal context, I developed both:
- Static models that use features extracted from a single 1-minute window of data.
- Time-series models that use a sliding 10-minute window of past data to forecast the next minute’s emotional state.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Compare static and time-series modeling for predicting stress, anxiety, and affect.
- Forecast the next minute of self-reported emotional state using the previous 10 minutes of HRV and EDA data.
- Compare classification models for stress/anxiety and regression models for positive/negative affect.
- Evaluate generalization to unseen patients under lab-induced conditions.
